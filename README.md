# recursion_as
**[Exercise 1](./Ex1.py)**: A function that takes in two numbers and recursively multiplies them together.  

**[Exercise 2](./Ex2.py)**: A function that takes in a base and an exp and recursively computes base exp without the use of the ** operator!  
  
**[Exercise 3](./Ex3.py)**: A function that uses recursion to print numbers from n to 0.  
  
**[Exercise 4](./Ex4.py)**: A function that uses recursion to print numbers from 0 to n (while changing just one line in the program of the previous problem)  
  
**[Exercise 5](./Ex5.py)**: A function using recursion that takes in a string and returns a reversed copy of the
string. The only string operation allowed to use is string concatenation.  
  
**[Exercise 6](./Ex6.py)**: A function using recursion to check if a number n is prime.  
  
**[Exercise 7](./Ex7.py)**: A recursive function that takes in one argument n and computes Fn, the n-th value
of the Fibonacci sequence.
